### WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)

**WSGI** is a standard interface between web servers and Python web applications. It is the default protocol for most Python web frameworks like Flask and Django.

- **Pros**:
  - **Widely Supported**: Compatible with most Python web frameworks.
  - **Mature and Stable**: Has been around for a long time with a robust ecosystem.
  - **Sufficient for Synchronous Applications**: Works well for traditional, synchronous web applications.

- **Cons**:
  - **No Native Asynchronous Support**: Not designed for handling asynchronous tasks; can't handle long-running or real-time connections efficiently.
  - **Less Suitable for High Concurrency**: Not ideal for applications that need to handle a large number of concurrent connections (e.g., WebSockets, real-time APIs).

### ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)

**ASGI** is a modern standard that builds on WSGI to provide both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities. It is designed to handle WebSockets, HTTP/2, and long-lived connections.

- **Pros**:
  - **Supports Asynchronous Programming**: Ideal for high-performance and real-time applications.
  - **High Concurrency**: Better suited for applications that require handling many concurrent requests.
  - **Flexible**: Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, WebSockets) and various web frameworks like FastAPI, Django Channels, and Starlette.

- **Cons**:
  - **Less Mature than WSGI**: While rapidly growing, it is not as battle-tested as WSGI in certain environments.
  - **Complexity**: May introduce more complexity in deployment and configuration compared to WSGI, especially for developers used to traditional synchronous patterns.

### Summary

- **Gunicorn**: Best suited for applications that need high performance, flexibility, and scalability. It is highly configurable and supports both synchronous and asynchronous workloads. However, it requires more setup and tuning.
- **Waitress**: Ideal for small to medium-sized applications that prioritize ease of setup and cross-platform compatibility. It is simpler to configure but less flexible and scalable compared to Gunicorn.


For model registry;

I selected Waitress for its ease of use and cross-platform compatibility, particularly because I developed the application on Windows before Dockerizing it. Waitress ensures that the code runs smoothly on both Windows and Linux environments. While Gunicorn offers better performance and flexibility, especially for larger-scale applications, I plan to switch to Gunicorn or even transition to an ASGI server in the future to take advantage of its scalability and asynchronous capabilities.
