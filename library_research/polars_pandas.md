3. **Limited Community Support**:
   - Has a growing but smaller community, which may limit the availability of community-contributed resources and troubleshooting.

4. **Potential Overhead for Simple Tasks**:
   - For simple, small-scale operations, the overhead of setting up lazy execution may not provide significant benefits over eager execution in pandas.


## Pandas

**Pandas** is a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis, widely used in data science and machine learning.

### Key Features

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Provides two primary data structures: `Series` (1-dimensional) and `DataFrame` (2-dimensional), making it easy to manipulate data.

2. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Supports powerful data manipulation operations, such as filtering, grouping, merging, and pivoting.

3. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - Offers functions for detecting, filling, or removing missing data, making data cleaning straightforward.

4. **Data I/O**:
   - Supports reading from and writing to multiple file formats, such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, JSON, and more.

5. **Integration with Other Libraries**:
   - Works well with other Python libraries like NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy, enhancing its capabilities for data analysis and visualization.

6. **Label-Based and Index-Based Slicing**:
   - Allows both label-based and position-based data slicing, making data selection intuitive.

### Pros
- **User-Friendly API**: Intuitive, similar to SQL, and easy for beginners.
- **Flexible Data Handling**: Excellent for small to medium-sized datasets.
- **Strong Community Support**: Extensive documentation, tutorials, and community contributions.

### Cons
- **Performance Limitations**: Can be slow and memory-intensive for very large datasets.
- **Single-Threaded**: Lacks multi-threaded processing, limiting scalability.




## Polars vs. Pandas

| Feature                     | **Polars**                                                                 | **Pandas**                                                         |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Performance**             | High performance due to Rust implementation; supports multi-threading.    | Slower for large datasets; single-threaded due to Python's GIL.    |
| **Execution Mode**          | Supports both eager and lazy execution for optimized query planning.      | Only eager execution; each operation is executed immediately.      |
| **Memory Usage**            | Efficient memory usage with Apache Arrow columnar format.                 | Higher memory usage; less efficient with larger datasets.          |
| **Ease of Use**             | Familiar API for pandas users; easy to learn for those familiar with pandas. | Very user-friendly API; well-documented with a large user base.    |
| **Handling Large Datasets** | Optimized for large datasets; can handle out-of-memory data processing.   | Limited by memory; may struggle with very large datasets.          |
